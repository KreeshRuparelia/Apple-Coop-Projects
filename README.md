**1. PhotoFrame App:**
As a part of the Apple Co-op program, a major part of the learning process involved
learning to develop Swift programs for iOS. During this learning journey, the very first
app I developed was a PhotoFrame App which would simply display an image on screen for the user.

Despite being such a simple concept, this app helped me understand the core principles of Swift, as
well as kickstarting my journey with iOS development.


**2. Question Bot App:**
The Question Bot app is a simple app which takes in input from the user and answers the questions
in a fun, quirky way! 

The purpose of this app was to discover how to take in input through a GUI and parse through it
to update the screen. This app enabled me to tinker around with user input and use conditions (such
as if and else) in Swift.


**3. Bouncy Ball App:**
The Bouncy Ball App is a fun game wherein the user must position all the wooden planks appropriately
and catch all the stars. Once the player thinks they have it right, they can click the funnel on the
top to drop a ball.

This app is a fun game, and the development of this app allowed me to learn skills such as dealing with
user input in a more interactive way, as I had to deal with touch input and screen interaction, a big step
up from the keyboard input of the Question Bot. I also had to learn to work with the Swift Physics module
to apply game physics and allow for the game to be realistic with its ball physics and bounce interactions.


**TRY IT OUT!**
In order to look at my apps, you must be using an Apple Computer as you will need to download XCode,
after you have XCode installed on your computer, you can download the repository and open up each project
and test them out by using the in-built XCode Simulator (use iPhone 11 in model selection) or download the app
locally on any iPhone by transferring it from XCode.
